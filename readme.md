Try it live at: https://sintel.pythonanywhere.com/

To run this locally, you need to create a venv to run Flask in.
Check out the tutorial here: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/
After activating the venv, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Then start the app using `python -u flask_app.py`

See [example.py](example.py) for an example on how to use the code as a library for your own calculations.

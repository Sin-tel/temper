## using the library

See [example.py](example.py) for an example on how to do your own calculations using the library.
Currently it is not distributed on pypi so you will just have to clone it.
The only dependency is numpy.

## run server locally

You need at least Python 3.10. The easiest way to run is by just making a venv and installing Flask in there.
Check out the tutorial here: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/.
After activating the venv, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Then start the app using `python -u flask_app.py`.

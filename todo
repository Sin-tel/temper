x always remove contorsion
x enter comma vectors
x reduce gens, always positive
x get preimage gens
x unweighted/weighted
x rational subgroups
x check if subgroup is valid (no 2.3.9 etc)
x vector pattern FutureWarning
x check solver for exact diophantine
x adapt solver for multi-row solve
x simplify subgroup
x speed up findmaps
x exact integer determinant
x complexity, error, badness
x check complexity invariant wrt basis

add tests for solver

plot complexity vs error for random temperaments

radio selector for basis [hnf, positive gen hnf, octave reduced, equave reduce, ...]

fast rank test?
cholesky weights?

use yield in pmap iterator

find optimal edo tunings
enter intervals to optimize
make results page look nicer
list more commas, sort by tenney/wilson
adaptive precision of outputs


make search

check LLL reduction fp
  https://github.com/higumachan/olll/blob/master/olll_numpy.py
  implement custom weights on dot product

when subgroup empty, infer from commas

reduce gens by commas
find more commas, sort by TE/wilson

naming scheme proposal

parser for ~ notation
  ie 9/8^2 ~ 5/4

custom weights

error msg
input validation
write tests

different bases:
  pergen form, mingen form, [period, generator, commas]

add xen-calc link to all ratios
  https://www.yacavone.net/xen-calc/?q=60/49

generate lattice
 - rank 2 -> easy
 - rank 3 -> uhhh, modulo octaves?

add scale workshop links,
need some way to figure out MOS and ?? for higher rank

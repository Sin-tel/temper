add type hints

better errors

cents precision should be adaptive

find optimal maps for edo input

search supported temps for an edo (irrespective of non-patent maps)
temperament search in general

switch for monospace formatting instead of latex

find additional commas, sort by wilson height

radio selector for basis [hnf, positive gen hnf, octave reduced, equave reduce, ...]

fast rank test?

make search better
 - only patent edos first?

add tests for solver

septimal meantone w just 5/4 and 7/4 is impossible because the intervals are collinear => deal w this properly

help page
enter intervals to optimize
make results page look nicer
list more commas, sort by tenney/wilson
when subgroup empty, infer from commas
make search

parser for ~ notation
  ie 9/8^2 ~ 5/4

custom weights

input validation
write tests

different bases:
  pergen form, mingen form, [period, generator, commas]

add xen-calc link to all ratios
  https://www.yacavone.net/xen-calc/?q=60/49

generate lattice
 - rank 2 -> easy
 - rank 3 -> ...

add scale workshop links,
need some way to figure out MOS and ?? for higher rank

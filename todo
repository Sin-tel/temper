x always remove contorsion
x enter comma vectors
x reduce gens, always positive
x get preimage gens
x unweighted/weighted
x rational subgroups
x check if subgroup is valid (no 2.3.9 etc)
x vector pattern FutureWarning
x check solver for exact diophantine
x adapt solver for multi-row solve
x simplify subgroup
x speed up findmaps
x exact integer determinant
x complexity, error, badness
x check complexity invariant wrt basis

find optimal maps for edo input

dont do combination search on edo input

correct kernel

monospace formatting instead of latex

check LLL reduction fp
  https://github.com/higumachan/olll/blob/master/olll_numpy.py
  implement custom weights on dot product

reduce gens by commas
sort commas by Wilson
find additional commas


radio selector for basis [hnf, positive gen hnf, octave reduced, equave reduce, ...]

fast rank test?
cholesky weights?

add tests for solver
use yield in pmap iterator

help page
enter intervals to optimize
make results page look nicer
list more commas, sort by tenney/wilson
adaptive precision of outputs
when subgroup empty, infer from commas
make search

naming scheme proposal

parser for ~ notation
  ie 9/8^2 ~ 5/4

custom weights
plot complexity vs error for random temperaments

error msg
input validation
write tests

different bases:
  pergen form, mingen form, [period, generator, commas]

add xen-calc link to all ratios
  https://www.yacavone.net/xen-calc/?q=60/49

generate lattice
 - rank 2 -> easy
 - rank 3 -> ...

add scale workshop links,
need some way to figure out MOS and ?? for higher rank

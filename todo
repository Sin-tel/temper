abstract scale search (mv3 etc)

find optimal maps for edo input

switch for monospace formatting instead of latex

find additional commas

radio selector for basis [hnf, positive gen hnf, octave reduced, equave reduce, ...]

radio selector for norm

fast rank test? 

better edo search
 - only search subspace where comma is tempered (ie image of temp in HNF w octaves stretched)
 - somehow get normal edo maps (?)
 - find join 
    * take best 2 (they wont be linearly dep anyway)
    * iterate further until we find one thats linearly indep (check fast via det(V*V^T))
    * iterate until rank r is reached

temp search
 - find good approximations first? (low badness)
 - easier for edos
 - find edo pairs that have a large angle wrt eachother
 - find good commas instead?

complexity under weil norm ~edo without normalization

automatically find target tuning by finding vectors that are small under the error functional of least squares

make search better
 - only patent edos first?

add tests for solver
use yield in pmap iterator

septimal meantone w just 5/4 and 7/4 is impossible because the intervals are collinear => deal w this properly

help page
enter intervals to optimize
make results page look nicer
list more commas, sort by tenney/wilson
adaptive precision of outputs
when subgroup empty, infer from commas
make search

naming scheme proposal

parser for ~ notation
  ie 9/8^2 ~ 5/4

custom weights
plot complexity vs error for random temperaments

error msg
input validation
write tests

different bases:
  pergen form, mingen form, [period, generator, commas]

add xen-calc link to all ratios
  https://www.yacavone.net/xen-calc/?q=60/49

generate lattice
 - rank 2 -> easy
 - rank 3 -> ...

add scale workshop links,
need some way to figure out MOS and ?? for higher rank

x always remove contorsion
x enter comma vectors
x reduce gens, always positive
x get preimage gens
x unweighted/weighted
x rational subgroups
x check if subgroup is valid (no 2.3.9 etc)
x vector pattern FutureWarning
x check solver for exact diophantine
x adapt solver for multi-row solve
x simplify subgroup

add tests for solver

plot complexity vs error for random temperaments

radio selector for basis [hnf, positive gen hnf, octave reduced, equave reduce, ...]

speed up findmaps, just check kernel?
 - search over all supporting pmaps
 - sort by badness
 - loop over all n choose k until finding map of full rank

fast rank test?
exact integer determinant
cholesky weights?

test 2.6.20 meantone with regular TE weights

use yield in pmap iterator

help page
find optimal edo tunings
enter intervals to optimize
make results page look nicer
list more commas, sort by tenney/wilson
adaptive precision of outputs


make search

check LLL reduction fp
  https://github.com/higumachan/olll/blob/master/olll_numpy.py
  implement custom weights on dot product

complexity, ~ gram matrix, = lattice volume
  check invariant wrt basis

when subgroup empty, infer from commas

reduce gens by commas
find more commas, sort by TE/wilson

naming scheme proposal

parser for ~ notation
  ie 9/8^2 ~ 5/4

custom weights

error msg
input validation
write tests

different bases:
  pergen form, mingen form, [period, generator, commas]

add xen-calc link to all ratios
  https://www.yacavone.net/xen-calc/?q=60/49

generate lattice
 - rank 2 -> easy
 - rank 3 -> uhhh, modulo octaves?

add scale workshop links,
need some way to figure out MOS and ?? for higher rank
